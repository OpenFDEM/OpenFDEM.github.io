Quick Start for Developers
===========================
This is the source code of C/C++ based OpenFDEM project developed by Dr Xiaofeng Li, 
since 2017-2022. This project supports a FDEM solver for continuum-discontinuum problems, but it is not limited to
FDEM problems. It containes particulate DEM solver, material point method solver and a phasefield solver as well.
The project can be complied by Visual Studio (> 2015) and compatible with Windows 7, 10 or Linux-like systems.

Tutorial examples can be found in ``..src\test\..``. The main file is located at ``src\solve\openfdem.cpp``. OpenFDEM is run by
parsing the input file. 

Steps to run model:

1. Open ``.sln`` project in ``\openfdem src\of\OpenFDEM\OpenFDEM.sln`` by your local Visual Studio software.

2. Compile the project in Visual Studio  from the ``src\solve\openfdem.cpp`` main file.

3. The executable code should be in ``x64\Release``(or ``Debug``), be sure to keep the ``.dll`` files in the same folder with ``.exe`` file.

4. Drag ``.of`` file into the ``.exe`` software then the model will starts to run, or use ``openfdem example.of`` in terminal to run a model.
